# Tools 101 & Experimentation Hub

A comprehensive repository documenting my journey through data science & machine learning tools, frameworks, and advanced applications. This space serves as both a learning log and a collection of hands-on experiments, implementations, and architectural explorations.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains:
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Deep dives into ML tools I'm learning (PyTorch, FastAPI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- **Hard Applications**: Complex, production-level implementations and use cases
- **Experimentations**: Research-oriented work, novel approaches, and ablation studies
- **Documentation**: Detailed notes, tutorials, and insights from learning process

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- GPU support (CUDA 12.1+) - recommended but not required
- Dependencies listed in individual project `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m101yosef/tools101.git
cd tools101
```

Install dependencies for specific projects:
```bash
cd fastapi/basic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 What You'll Find
Each tool has its own workspace with:
- Fundamental tutorials and basic usage
- Intermediate-to-advanced concepts
- Practical examples and code snippets
- Comparisons with other frameworks
- Performance benchmarks

## 💡 Key Areas of Focus

- **Deep Learning**: Neural network architectures, training strategies, optimization
- **NLP**: Language models, transformers, fine-tuning, prompt engineering
- **Computer Vision**: CNNs, object detection, segmentation, vision transformers
- **MLOps**: Model serving, monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, containerization
- **Optimization**: Quantization, pruning, distillation, efficient inference
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU setups, distributed data parallelism

## 📝 How to Use This Repo

1. **For Learning**: Start with tools directory for framework tutorials, then move to applications for practical use cases
2. **For Reference**: Use docs and individual project READMEs for quick setup and understanding
3. **For Reproduction**: Each significant experiment includes a detailed README with exact commands to reproduce results
4. **For Inspiration**: Check experiments for novel approaches or optimization techniques

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Each subdirectory contains a `STATUS.md` file tracking:
- Completed concepts and implementations
- Current focus areas
- Upcoming explorations
- Key learnings and takeaways

## 🤝 Contributing to Self

Guidelines for keeping this repo organized:
- Document assumptions and design decisions
- Include failure cases and lessons learned
- Write clear, reproducible code with comments
- Keep experiments isolated and reproducible
- Update progress tracking regularly

## 📚 Resources & References

Each project includes references to:
- Official documentation links
- Research papers
- Tutorial sources
- Community resources
- Relevant blog posts and articles

## ⚠️ Notes

- Some experiments may be incomplete or ongoing
- Code quality varies—tools directory is production-ready, experiments may be research-grade
- Dependencies are versioned to match training environment; newer versions may require adjustments
- GPU memory requirements vary per project—check individual READMEs
